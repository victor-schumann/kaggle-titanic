# Kaggle Titanic Challenge - Machine Learning from Disaster 
<p align="justify">The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/wilexroger/titanic-challenge/">Kaggle Titanic Challenge</a> is a famous machine learning problem that serves as a great introduction to some of the possibilities of the "Pandas" & "Numpy" python libraries. This repo is a place for me to save my attempts and code files submitted to the challenge.</p>

 <p align="justify">This notebook was my first approach to the challenge and to data science: despite the good score, it wasn't a feat I'm particularly proud.I followed the great tutorial provided by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial/notebook">Alexis Cook</a> on the platform.</p>
 <p align="justify">While it was still daunting and scary, following this tutorial proved to be simple, hands on, and comprehensible. I could not get rid of the impostor feeling that I was just copying and pasting code, but it was a good way to start my journey through data science, and I'm excited for the moment that I will intuitively know how to tacke this challenge myself.</p>
